This web app uses the http://unsplash.it API to grab random images from http://unsplash.com and display them in a slideshow format on the users screen. 

It works purely on javascript and it should work on a majority of modern browsers.

Currently allows the user to change the speed at which the images will change/transition and allows the user to blur the image with the API.

Feel free to fork it and make it better.
